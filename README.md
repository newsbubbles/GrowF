Grow Function: Generate 3D Stacked Bifurcating Double Deep Cellular Automata based organisms which differentiate using a Genetic Algorithm... 

TLDR; High Def Living Trees that you can breed, trim and mint as NFTs on Solana, Ethereum, Cardano and other blockchain networks.

## The Metaverse Needs Trees

## We Have the Technology

Recent developments in the fields of Cellular Automata and Genetic Algorithms have led to the possibility of growing living organisms in higher dimensions.  Many projects like Lenia, The Life Engine and even VR games like Playne, and Inward have made a big deal of living organisms in games and tech culture.  These living organisms can behave like bacteria, like larger soft-bodied oganisms, or like Trees.  On a scientific level, there exist virtual living ecosystems of over 500,000 plants in simulations like the ones seen in the paper "[Synthetic Silviculture: Multi-Scale Modeling of Plant Ecosystems](https://storage.googleapis.com/pirk.io/projects/synthetic_silviculture/index.html)".
